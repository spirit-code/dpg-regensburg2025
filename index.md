Time: *17:30-18:15*

## Preparation
- Bring a charged laptop.

- Meet us on March 16 at *17:30-18:15*

## Content
- simulating the atomistic spin Hamiltonian
- energy minimization for magnetic textures
- atomistic LLG-dynamics
- extracting simulation parameters from a scientific paper
- calculating the skyrmion collapse barrier using the GNEB-method
- influence of a magnetic field on the FM and AFM skyrmion radius
- current driven skyrmion dynamics and skyrmion Hall angle
- Monte Carlo method to characterize Curie temperature and anisotropy energy

## After the Tutorial
All of the notebooks are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/spirit-code/dpg-regensburg2025).
If you want to have access to the solutions you can check out the [`solution`](https://github.com/spirit-code/dpg-regensburg2025/tree/solution) branch.

## Additional Information
The tutorial is preceded by two lectures deriving the Atomistic Spin-Hamiltonian and how it connects to DFT results:
- *16:00–16:45* Derivation of the spin-lattice Hamiltonian - Hiroshi Katsumoto
- *16:45–17:30* Computing magnetic exchange interactions using DFT - Manuel dos Santos Dias
